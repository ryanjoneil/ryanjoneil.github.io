      <description>Minimize overbooking while scheduling team meetings</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a <a href="https://nextmv.io">Nextmv</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTeit7TAWj4">tech talk</a> a couple weeks ago, I showed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_absolute_deviations">least absolute deviations</a> (LAD) regression model using OR-Tools. This isn&rsquo;t new &ndash; I pulled the formulation from Rob Vanderbei&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://vanderbei.princeton.edu/tex/LocalWarming/LocalWarmingSIREVrev.pdf">Local Warming</a>&rdquo; paper, and I&rsquo;ve shown similar models at conference talks in the past using other modeling APIs and solvers.</p>
<p>There are a couple reasons I keep coming back to this problem. One is that it&rsquo;s a great example of how to build a machine learning model using an optimization solver. Unless you have an optimization background, it&rsquo;s probably not obvious you can do this. Building a regression or classification model with a solver directly is a great way to understand the model better. And you can customize it in interesting ways, like adding <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/lectures/ml/2011/lect6.pdf">epsilon insensitivity</a>.</p>
<p>Another is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least squares</a>, while most commonly used regression form, has a fatal flaw: it isn&rsquo;t robust to outliers in the input data. This is because least squares minimize the <em>sum of squared residuals</em>, as shown in the formulation below. Here, $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix of feature data, $b$ is a vector of observations to fit, and $x$ is a vector of coefficients the optimizer must find.</p>
<p>$$
\min f(x) = \Vert Ax-b \Vert^2
$$</p>
<p>Since the objective function minimizes squared residuals, outliers have a much bigger impact than other data. LAD regression solves this by simply summing the values of the residuals as they are.</p>
<p>$$
\min f(x) = \vert Ax-b \vert
$$</p>
<p>So why isn&rsquo;t this used more? Simple &ndash; least squares has a convenient analytical solution, while LAD requires an algorithm to solve. For instance, you can formulate LAD regression as a linear program, but now you need a solver.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
\min         \quad &amp; 1&rsquo;z \\
\text{s.t.}\ \quad &amp; z \ge Ax - b \\
&amp; z \ge b - Ax
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>While I like using this example, it paints a rather negative picture of squaring. If it does funny things to solvers, is there any good reason to square? Thus I&rsquo;ve been on the lookout for a practical example where squaring a variable or expression makes a model more useful.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, Erwin Kalvelagen recently <a href="https://yetanothermathprogrammingconsultant.blogspot.com/2023/10/scheduling-team-meetings.html">posted</a> about using optimization to schedule team meetings. This is an application where minimizing squared values of <em>overbooking</em> can be beneficial &ndash; it may be worse to be triple booked than double booked.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t recreate the reasoning behind Erwin&rsquo;s post here. You can read his blog for that. What we&rsquo;ll do is look at both the formulations in his post, along with a couple extras using <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> for code, <a href="https://jump.dev/">JuMP</a> for modeling, <a href="https://www.scipopt.org/">SCIP</a> for optimization, and <a href="https://gadflyjl.org/stable/">Gadfly</a> for visualization. All model code and data are linked in the resources section at the end.</p>
<h2 id="maximize-attendance">Maximize attendance</h2>
<p>To start off, I built a new data set, which you can find in the resources section. This differentiates team membership between two types of employees: individual contributors (starting with <code>ic</code> in the data), who attend meetings for 1 or 2 teams, and managers (prefixed with <code>mgr</code>), who attend meetings to coordinate across multiple teams. We schedule meetings for 10 teams (prefix <code>t</code>) into 3 time slots (<code>s</code>).</p>
<p>The first model in Erwin&rsquo;s post maximizes attendance. This means it tries to schedule team members for as many unique time slots as possible. It doesn&rsquo;t consider overbooking.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
\max\quad       &amp; \sum_{i,s} y_{i,s} \\
\text{s.t.}\quad&amp; \sum_{s} x_{t,s} = 1                  &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t   &amp; \text{schedule each team meeting once}\\
&amp; y_{i,s} \le \sum_{t} m_{i,t}\ x_{t,s} &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s &amp; \text{individuals attend team meetings}\\
&amp; x_{t,s} \in \{0,1\}                 &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t,s\\
&amp; y_{i,s} \in \{0,1\}                 &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>This yields the following team schedule, with red representing a scheduled team meeting.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-11-26-reducing-overscheduling/maximize-attendance-teams.svg" alt="Maximize attendance - team schedules"  />
</p>
<p>If we look at the manager schedules, we&rsquo;ll see that every manager is completely booked. This makes sense. That&rsquo;s what managers do, right? Go to meetings?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-11-26-reducing-overscheduling/maximize-attendance-managers.svg" alt="Maximize attendance - manager attendance"  />
</p>
<h2 id="minimize-overbooking">Minimize overbooking</h2>
<p>The model gets more interesting once we account for overbooking. Erwin&rsquo;s post has a model that minimizes overbooking, where overbooking is the number of additional meetings in a time slot. If a team member is double booked, that&rsquo;s 1 overbooking. If they are triple booked, that&rsquo;s 2 overbookings.</p>
<h3 id="sum-of-overbooking">Sum of overbooking</h3>
<p>The second model in Erwin&rsquo;s post minimizes the sum of all overbookings. He does this by adding a continuous <code>c</code> vector that only incurs value once a team member goes over a single meeting in a given time slot.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
\min\quad       &amp; \sum_{i,s} c_{i,s} \\
\text{s.t.}\quad&amp; \sum_{s} x_{t,s} = 1                      &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t   &amp; \text{schedule each team meeting once}\\
&amp; c_{i,s} \ge \sum_{t} m_{i,t}\ x_{t,s} - 1 &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s &amp; \text{measure overbooking}\\
&amp; x_{t,s} \in \{0,1\}                     &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t,s\\
&amp; c_{i,s} \ge 0                             &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>Given our data this results in the following team schedule, which is probably not all that interesting. I&rsquo;ll leave this visualization out from now on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-11-26-reducing-overscheduling/minimize-overbooking-teams.svg" alt="Minimize overbooking - team schedules"  />
</p>
<p>Where it gets interesting is plotting overbookings for the managers. Here we see that 3 manager time slots are triple booked <em>(red)</em>, while 8 are double booked <em>(gray)</em>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-11-26-reducing-overscheduling/minimize-overbooking-managers.svg" alt="Minimize overbooking - manager overbooking"  />
</p>
<h3 id="sum-of-squared-overbooking">Sum of squared overbooking</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s worse to triple book (or, gasp, <em>quadruple</em> book) than to double book. How can the model account for this? One answer, if you have a MIQP-enabled solver, is to simply square the <code>c</code> values.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
\min\quad       &amp; \sum_{i,s} c_{i,s}^2 \\
\text{s.t.}\quad&amp; \sum_{s} x_{t,s} = 1                      &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t   &amp; \text{schedule each team meeting once}\\
&amp; c_{i,s} \ge \sum_{t} m_{i,t}\ x_{t,s} - 1 &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s &amp; \text{measure overbooking}\\
&amp; x_{t,s} \in \{0,1\}                     &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t,s\\
&amp; c_{i,s} \ge 0                             &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>This completely eliminates triple booking, as shown below. No manager is worse off than being double booked, which seems normal given my experiences.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-11-26-reducing-overscheduling/minimize-overbooking-squared-managers.svg" alt="Minimize squared overbooking - manager overbooking"  />
</p>
<p>The problem with this is that the solver now takes a lot longer. It&rsquo;s not bad for the data in this example, but if you try it with something larger you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. You can find the data generator code in the resources section.</p>
<h3 id="constrained-bottleneck">Constrained bottleneck</h3>
<p>So how can we do something similar without the computational cost? One option is to continue using MILP formulations, but in the context of hierarchical optimization. This means splitting the model into two. First, we try to minimize the maximum overbookings for any team member (the <em>bottleneck</em>, if you will). This involves adding a variable $b$ representing that maximum.</p>
<p>$$ b = \max\Bigl\{\sum_{t} m_{i,t}\ x_{t,s} - 1 : i \in I, s \in S \Bigr\} $$</p>
<p>Now we can simply minimize $b$ using a MILP instead of a MIQP.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
\min\quad       &amp; b \\
\text{s.t.}\quad&amp; \sum_{s} x_{t,s} = 1                &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t   &amp; \text{schedule each team meeting once}\\
&amp; b \ge \sum_{t} m_{i,t}\ x_{t,s} - 1 &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s &amp; \text{maximum overbooking}\\
&amp; x_{t,s} \in \{0,1\}               &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t,s
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>Once we solve the first model, we get the minimal value of $b$, which we call $b^*$. We can simply use $b^*$ as an upper bound for overbookings in the second original model.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
\min\quad       &amp; \sum_{i,s} c_{i,s} \\
\text{s.t.}\quad&amp; \sum_{s} x_{t,s} = 1                      &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t   &amp; \text{schedule each team meeting once}\\
&amp; c_{i,s} \ge \sum_{t} m_{i,t}\ x_{t,s} - 1 &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s &amp; \text{measure overbooking}\\
&amp; x_{t,s} \in \{0,1\}                     &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t,s\\
&amp; 0 \le c_{i,s} \le b^*                     &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,s
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>As we see below, this model also eliminates triple bookings, and it&rsquo;s quite a bit faster to solve than the MIQP.</p>

      <title>🖍 Visualizing Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://ryanjoneil.github.io/posts/2023-09-13-visualizing-decision-diagrams/</link>

      <description>A look at a few tools for visualizing decision diagrams</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I attended <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dpsolve2023/">DPSOLVE 2023</a> recently and found lots of good inspiration for the next version of Nextmv&rsquo;s Decision Diagram (DD) solver, <a href="https://www.nextmv.io/blog/how-hop-hops">Hop</a>. It&rsquo;s a few years old now, and we learned a lot applying it in the field. Hop formed the basis for our first routing models. While those models moved to a different structure in our <a href="https://www.nextmv.io/docs/vehicle-routing/get-started">latest routing code</a>, the <a href="https://www.nextmv.io/docs/vehicle-routing/legacy/routing">first version</a> broke ground combining DDs with Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), and its use continues to grow organically.</p>
<p>A feature I&rsquo;d love for Hop is the ability to visualize DDs and monitor the search. That could work interactively, like Gecode&rsquo;s <a href="https://researchmgt.monash.edu/ws/portalfiles/portal/257776846/3566886_oa.pdf">GIST</a>, or passively during the search process. This requires automatic generation of images representing potentially large diagrams. So I spent a few hours looking at graph rendering options for DDs.</p>
<h2 id="manual-rendering">Manual rendering</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with examples of visualizations built by hand. These form a good standard for how we want DDs to look if we automate rendering. We&rsquo;ll start with some examples from academic literature, look at some we&rsquo;ve used in <a href="https://nextmv.io">Nextmv</a> presentations, and show an interesting example that embeds in <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, the popular static site generator I use for this blog.</p>
<p>All the literature on using Decision Diagrams (DD) for optimization that I&rsquo;m aware of depicts DDs as top-down, layered, directed graphs (digraphs). Some of the diagrams we come across appear to be coded and rendered, while some are fussily created by hand with a diagramming tool.</p>
<h3 id="academia">Academia</h3>
<p>I believe most of of the examples we find in academic literature are coded by hand and rendered using the LaTeX <a href="https://tikz.net/">TikZ</a> package. Below is one of the first diagrams that newcomers to DDs encounter. It&rsquo;s from <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-42849-9">Decision Diagrams for Optimization</a> by Bergman et al, 2016.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-09-13-visualizing-decision-diagrams/ddo-exact-relaxed.png" alt="Exact &amp;amp; relaxed BDDs"  />
</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter here what model this represents. It&rsquo;s a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD), which means that each variable can be $0$ or $1$. The BDD on the left is exact, while the BDD on the right is a relaxed version of the same.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a bit going on, so it&rsquo;s worth an explanation. Let&rsquo;s look at the &ldquo;exact&rdquo; BDD on the left first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal layers group arcs with a binary variable (e.g. $x_1$, $x_2$).</li>
<li>Arcs assign either the value $0$ or $1$ to their layer&rsquo;s variable. Dotted lines assign $0$ while solid lines assign $1$.</li>
<li>Arc labels specify their costs. The BDD searches for a longest (or shortest) path from the root node $r$ to the terminal node $t$.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; BDD on the right <em>overapproximates</em> both the objective value and the set of feasible solutions of the exact BDD on the left.</p>
<ul>
<li>The diagram is limited to a fixed width (2, in this case) at each layer.</li>
<li>The achieve this, the DD merges exact nodes together.</li>
<li>Thus, on the left of the relaxed BDD, there is a single node in which $x_2$ can be $0$ or $1$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of an exact BDD from the same book.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-09-13-visualizing-decision-diagrams/ddo-exact.png" alt="Exact BDD"  />
</p>
<p>In this diagram, each node has a state. For example, the state of $r$ is $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. If we start at the root node $r$ and assign $x_1 = 0$, we end up at node $u_1$ with state $\{2,3,4,5\}$.</p>
<p>Most other academic literature about DDs uses images similar to these.</p>
<h3 id="nextmv">Nextmv</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve rendered a number of DDs over the years at <a href="https://nextmv.io">Nextmv</a>. Most of these images demonstrate a concept instead of a particular model. We usually create them by hand in a diagramming tool like <a href="https://whimsical.com/">Whimsical</a>, <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">Lucidchart</a>, or <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>. I built the diagrams below by hand in Whimsical. I think the result is nice, if time consuming and fussy.</p>
<p>This is a representation of an exact DD. It doesn&rsquo;t indicate whether this is a BDD or a Multivalued Decision Diagram (MDD). It doesn&rsquo;t have any labels or variable names. It just shows what a DD search might look like in the abstract.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-09-13-visualizing-decision-diagrams/nextmv-dd-exact.png" alt="Exact DD"  />
</p>
<p>The restricted DD below is more involved. It addition to horizontal layers, it divides nodes into explored and deferred groups. Most of the examples I&rsquo;ve seen mix different types of nodes, like exact and relaxed. I really like differentiating node types like this.</p>
<p>In this representation, deferred nodes are in Hop&rsquo;s queue for later exploration. Thus they don&rsquo;t connect to any child nodes yet. This is the kind of thing I&rsquo;d like to generate with real diagrams during search so I can examine the state of the solver.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-09-13-visualizing-decision-diagrams/nextmv-dd-restricted.png" alt="Restricted DD"  />
</p>
<p>My favorite of my DD renderings so far is the next one. This shows a single-vehicle pickup-and-delivery problem. The arc labels are stops (e.g. 🐶, 🐱). The path the 🚗 follows to the terminal node is the route. The gray boxes group together nodes to merge based on state to reduce isomorphisms out of the diagram.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-09-13-visualizing-decision-diagrams/nextmv-pdp-reduced.png" alt="Reduced MDD"  />
</p>
<p>We also have some images like those in our <a href="https://www.nextmv.io/blog/introducing-expanders-in-hop">post on expanders</a> by hand. As you can see, coding these by hand gets tedious.</p>
<h3 id="goat">GoAT</h3>
<p>TikZ is a program that renders manually coded graphics, while Whimsical is a WYSIWYG diagram editor. I like the Whimsical images a lot better &ndash; they feel cleaner and easier to understand.</p>
<p>Hugo <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/diagrams/#goat-diagrams-ascii">supports GoAT diagrams</a> by default, so I tried that out too. Here is an arbitrary MDD with two layers. The $[[1,2],4]$ node is a relaxed node; it doesn&rsquo;t really matter here what the label means.</p>

<p>I like the way GoAT renders this diagram. It&rsquo;s very readable. Unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t easy to automate. Creating a GoAT diagram is like using ASCII as a WYSIWYG diagramming tool, as you can see from the code for that image.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ll look at a couple options for automatically generating visualizations of DDs. These convert descriptions of graphs into images.</p>
<h3 id="graphviz">Graphviz</h3>
<p><a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> is the tried and true graph visualizer. It&rsquo;s used in the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/pprof">Go <code>pprof</code></a> library for examining CPU and memory profiles, and lots of other places.</p>
<p>Graphviz accepts a language called <a href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT</a>. It uses different <a href="https://graphviz.org/docs/layouts/">layout engines</a> to convert input into a visual representation. The user doesn&rsquo;t have control over node position. That&rsquo;s the job of the layout engine.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the same MDD as written in DOT. The <code>start -&gt; end</code> lines specify arcs in the digraph. The subgraphs organize nodes into layers. We add a dotted border around each layer and a label to say which variable it assigns. There isn&rsquo;t any way of vertically centering and horizontally aligning the layer labels, so I thought it make more sense this way.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-dot" data-lang="dot">digraph G {
    s1 [label = 0]
    s2 [label = &#34;[[1,2],4]&#34;]
    s3 [label = 3]
    s4 [label = 10]
    s5 [label = 20]
    s6 [label = 100]

    r -&gt; s1 [label = 2]
    r -&gt; s2 [label = 4]
    r -&gt; s3 [label = 1]
    s2 -&gt; s4 [label = 10]
    s2 -&gt; s5 [label = 4]
    s3 -&gt; s6 [label = 2]

    subgraph cluster_0 {
        label = &#34;x1&#34;
        labeljust = &#34;l&#34;
        style = &#34;dotted&#34;
        s1
        s2
        s3
    }

    subgraph cluster_1 {
        label = &#34;x2&#34;
        labeljust = &#34;l&#34;
        style = &#34;dotted&#34;
        s4
        s5
        s6
    }

    s4 -&gt; t
    s5 -&gt; t
    s6 -&gt; t
}
</code></pre><p>The result is comprehensible if not very attractive. With some fiddling, it&rsquo;s possible to improve things like the spacing around arc labels. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to align the layer labels and boxes. It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible to move the relaxed nodes into their own column either, but that limitation isn&rsquo;t unique to Graphviz.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2023-09-13-visualizing-decision-diagrams/graphviz-dd.png" alt="Graphviz DD"  />
</p>
<h3 id="mermaid">Mermaid</h3>
<p><a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a> is a JavaScript library for diagramming and charting. One can use it on the web or, presumably, embed it in an application.</p>
<p>Mermaid is similar to Graphviz in many ways, but it supports more diagram types. The input for that MDD in Mermaid is a bit simpler. Labels go inside arcs (e.g. <code>-- 2 --&gt;</code>), and there are more sensible rendering defaults.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The result has a lot of the same limitations as the Graphviz version, but it looks more like the GoAT version. The biggest problem, as we see below, is that it&rsquo;s not possible to left-align the layer labels. They can be obscured by arcs.</p>
<script type="module">
    import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
    let isDark = document.body.className.includes('dark');
    mermaid.initialize({theme: (isDark) ? 'dark' : 'neutral'});
</script>

<center>
    <div class="mermaid">

    stop((( )))
    A(0)
    B("[[1,2],4]")
    C(3)
    D(10)
    E(20)
    F(100)

    start -- 2 --> A
    start -- 4 --> B
    start -- 1 --> C
    B -- 10 --> D
    B -- 4 --> E
    C -- 2 --> F
    D --> stop
    E --> stop
    F --> stop

    subgraph "x1 "
        A; B; C
    end
    subgraph "x2"
        D; E; F
    end

    </div>
</center>
<p>This got me thinking that there isn&rsquo;t a strong reason DDs have to progress downward layer by layer. They could just as easily go from left to right. If we change the opening line from <code>graph TD</code> to <code>graph LR</code>, then we get the following image.</p>
<script type="module">

<p>I think that&rsquo;s pretty nice for a generated image.</p>

      <title>🚀 Blogging is back, baby!</title>
      <link>https://ryanjoneil.github.io/posts/2023-09-07-blogging-is-back/</link>

      <description>New adventures in optimization</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been a mostly absent blogger for the past few years. I could make excuses. They might sound like, &ldquo;I was busy finishing my dissertation!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I founded a company and have a toddler!&rdquo; or &ldquo;The <a href="https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus">static site generator</a> I used was abandoned!&rdquo; Whatever they might be, these excuses would certainly end in exclamation points.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, for several years it just felt like blogging was <em>dead</em>. Its space was usurped by Tweets, LinkedIn hustle posts, long form Medium content aimed at attracting talent, and other content trends. RSS feeds dried up bit by bit. That beautiful structure somewhere between a college essay and an academic preprint mostly ceased to be. Sad times, indeed.</p>
<p>That trend seems to be reversing. I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s the result of nudges from Substack, or that all the introverts in tech finally gave up baking pandemic, but there is a lot of good content out there again! Fire up your <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">RSS aggregators</a> and get reading.</p>
<p>This post is my own reboot of &ldquo;adventures in optimization,&rdquo; a blog I&rsquo;ve written intermittently since 2009. Unfortunately, it will take some time to move over all my old posts to Hugo. I&rsquo;ll do that slowly as I create new ones. For now, I&rsquo;ve ported over a couple early posts and put together a list of the active blogs I&rsquo;m gleefully catching up on.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

      <description>An integer programming formulation of the magic squares problem.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was updated to work with Python 3 and <a href="https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt">PySCIPOpt</a>. The original version used Python 2 and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-zibopt/">python-zibopt</a>. It has also been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p>Back in October of 2011, I started toying with a model for finding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square">magic squares</a> using SCIP. This is a fun modeling exercise and a challenging problem. First one constructs a square matrix of integer-valued variables.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> pyscipopt <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> Model
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># [...snip...]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>m <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Model()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>matrix <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> []
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> range(size):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    row <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addVar(vtype<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;I&#34;</span>, lb<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>) <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> _ <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> range(size)]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> row:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addCons(x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> M)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    matrix<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>append(row)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then one adds the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>All variables ≥ 1.</li>
<li>All rows, columns, and the diagonal sum to the same value.</li>
<li>All variables take different values.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two constraints are trivial to implement, and relatively easy for the solver. What I do is add a single extra variable then set it equal to the sums of each row, column, and the diagonal.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sum_val <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addVar(vtype<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;M&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> range(size):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addCons(sum(matrix[i]) <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> sum_val)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addCons(sum(matrix[j][i] <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> j <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> range(size)) <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> sum_val)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addCons(sum(matrix[i][i] <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> range(size)) <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> sum_val)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It&rsquo;s the third that messes things up. You can think of this as saying, for every possible pair of integer-valued variables $x$ and $y$:</p>
<p>$$ x \ge y + 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x \le y - 1 $$</p>
<p>Why is this hard? Because we can&rsquo;t add both constraints to the model. That would make it infeasible. Instead, we add write them in such a way that exactly one will be active for any any given solution. This requires, for each pair of variables, an additional binary variable $z$ and a (possibly big) constant $M$. Thus we reformulate the above as:</p>
<p>$$
x \ge (y + 1) - M z \
x \le (y - 1) + M (1-z) \
z \in {0,1}
$$</p>
<p>In code this looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> itertools <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> chain
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>all_vars <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> list(chain(<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>matrix))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i, x <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> enumerate(all_vars):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> all_vars[i<span style="color:#f92672">+</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:]:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addVar(vtype<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;B&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addCons(x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;=</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> M<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>z)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        m<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>addCons(x <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> M<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span><span style="color:#f92672">-</span>z))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, <a href="https://orinanobworld.blogspot.com/2011/07/perils-of-big-m.html">here be dragons</a>. We may not know how big (or small) to make $M$. Generally we want it as small as possible to make the LP relaxation of our integer programming model tighter. Different values of $M$ have unpredictable effects on solution time.</p>
<p>Which brings us to an interesting idea:</p>
<p>SCIP now supports bilinear constraints. This means that I can make $M$ a variable in the above model.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> sys

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The magic square model linked to in this post provides both options. The first command line argument it requires is the matrix size. The second one, $M$, is optional. If not given, it leaves $M$ up to the solver.</p>
<p>An interesting exercise for the reader: Change <a href="/files/2012-01-12-magic-squares-and-big-ms/magic-square.py">the code</a> to search for a <em>minimal</em> magic square, which minimizes either the value of $M$ or the sums of the columns, rows, and diagonal.</p>

      <description>More on the importance of time complexity in basic programming</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to <a href="../2011-10-25-know-your-time-complexities/">this</a> post, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">Ben Bitdiddle</a> inquires:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand the concept of using a companion set to remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order of its elements. But what should I do if these elements are composed of smaller pieces? For instance, say I am generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination">combinations</a> of numbers in which order is unimportant. How do I make a set recognize that <code>[1,2,3]</code> is the same as <code>[3,2,1]</code> in this case?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a couple points that should help here.</p>
<p>While lists are unhashable and therefore cannot be put into sets, tuples are perfectly capable of this. Therefore I cannot do this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>s <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> set()

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>s<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>add( (<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>) )
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>(3,2,1)</code> and <code>(1,2,3)</code> may not hash to the same thing, but tuples are easily sortable. If I sort them before adding them to a set, they look the same.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If I want to be a little fancier, I can user <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations"><code>itertools.combinations</code></a>. The following generates all unique 3-digit combinations of integers from 1 to 4:</p>

      <description>The importance of time complexity in basic programming</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is based on a lightning talk I gave at the LA PyLadies October Hackathon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not going to go into anything much resembling algorithmic complexity here. What I&rsquo;d like to do is present a common performance anti-pattern that I see from novice programmers about once every year or so. If I can prevent one person from committing this error, this post will have achieved its goal. I&rsquo;d also like to show how an intuitive understanding of time required by operations in relation to the size of data they operate on can be helpful.</p>
<p>Say you have a Big List of Things. It doesn&rsquo;t particularly matter what these things are. Often they might be objects or dictionaries of denormalized data. In this example we&rsquo;ll use numbers. Let&rsquo;s generate a list of 1 million integers, each randomly chosen from the first 100 thousand natural numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> random
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>choices <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> range(<span style="color:#ae81ff">100000</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [random<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>choice(choices) <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> range(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1000000</span>)]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now say you want to remove (or aggregate, or structure) duplicate data while keeping them <em>in order of appearance</em>. Intuitively, this seems simple enough. A first solution might involve creating a new empty list, iterating over x, and only appending those items that are not already in the new list.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad-way">The Bad Way</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>order <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> []
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> x:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> i <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> order:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        order<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>append(i)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Try running this. What&rsquo;s wrong with it?</p>
<p>The issue is the conditional on line 3. In the worst case, it could look at every item in the order list for each item in x. If the list is big, as it is in our example, that wastes a lot of cycles. We can reason that we can improve the performance of our code by replacing this conditional with something faster.</p>

<p>Given that sets have near constant time for membership tests, one solution is to create a companion data structure, which we&rsquo;ll call seen. Being a set, it doesn&rsquo;t care about the order of the items, but it will allow us to test for membership quickly.</p>

<p>Not that this is the best way to perform this particular action. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with it, take a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby"><code>groupby</code></a> function from <code>itertools</code>, which is what I will sometimes reach for in a case like this.</p>

      <title>🎰 Deterministic vs. Stochastic Simulation</title>

      <description>The importance of randomness in simulations</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I find I have to build simulations with increasing frequency in my work and life. Usually this indicates I&rsquo;m faced with one of the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need for a quick estimate regarding the quantitative behavior of some situation.</li>
<li>The desire to verify the result of a computation or assumption.</li>
<li>A situation which is too complex or random to effectively model or understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone familiar at all with simulation will recognize the last item as the motivating force of the entire field. Simulation models tend to take over when systems become so complex that understanding them is prohibitive in cost and time or entirely infeasible. In a simulation, the modeler can focus on individual interactions between entities while still hoping for useful output in the form of descriptive statistics.</p>
<p>As such, simulations are nearly always stochastic. The output of a simulation, whether it be the mean time to service upon entering a queue or the number of fish alive in a pond, is determined by a number of random inputs. It is estimated by looking at a sample of the entire, often infinite, problem space and therefore must be described in terms of mean and variance.</p>
<p>For me, simulation building usually follows a process roughly like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with a domain expert to understand the process under study.</li>
<li>Convert this process into a deterministic simulation (no randomness).</li>
<li>Verify the output of the deterministic simulation.</li>
<li>Anlyze the inputs of the simulation to determine their probability distributions.</li>
<li>Convert the deterministic simulation to a stochastic simulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for creating a simulation without randomness first is that it can be difficult or impossible to verify its correctness otherwise. Thus one may focus on the simulation logic first before analyzing and adding sources of randomness.</p>
<p>Where the procedure breaks down is after the third step. Domain experts are often happy to share their knowledge about systems to aid in designing simulations, and typically can understand the resulting abstractions. They are also invaluable in verifying simulation output. However, they are unlikely to understand why it is necessary to add randomness to a system that they already perceive as functional. Further, doing so can be just as difficult and time consuming as the initial model development and therefore requires justification.</p>
<p>This can be a quandary for the model builder. How does one communicate the need to incorporate randomness to decision makers who lack understanding of probability? It is trivially easy to construct simulations that use the same input parameters but yield drastically different outputs. Consider the code below, which simulates two events occurring and counts the number of times event b happens before event a.</p>

      <description>Solve graph problems on multiple cores NetworkX and Python futures</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was updated to work with <a href="https://networkx.org/">NetworkX</a> and for clarity.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible this will turn out like the day when Python 2.5 introduced [coroutines][coroutines]. At the time I was very excited. I spent several hours trying to convince my coworkers we should immediately abandon all our existing Java infrastructure and port it to finite state machines implemented using Python coroutines. After a day of hand waving over a proof of concept, we put that idea aside and went about our lives.</p>
<p>Soon after, I left for a Python shop, but in the next half decade I still never found a good place to use this interesting feature.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t feel like that.</p>
<p>As I come to terms more with switching to Python 3.2, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/py3k/library/concurrent.futures.html">futures</a> module seems similarly exciting. I wish I&rsquo;d had it years ago, and it&rsquo;s almost reason in itself to upgrade from Python 2.7. <em>Who cares if none of your libraries have been ported yet?</em></p>
<p>This library lets you take any function and distribute it over a process pool. To test that out, we&rsquo;ll generate a bunch of random graphs and iterate over all their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)">cliques</a>.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s generate some test data using the <a href="https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.gnm_random_graph.html"><code>dense_gnm_random_graph</code></a> function. Our data includes 1000 random graphs, each with 100 nodes and 100 * 100 edges.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> networkx <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> nx

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now we write a function iterate over all cliques in a given graph. NetworkX provides a <code>find_cliques</code> function which returns a generator. Iterating over them ensures we will run through the entire process of finding all cliques for a graph.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">iterate_cliques</span>(g):

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This function accepts a matrix <code>A</code> which contains all technological coefficients for an LP, a vector <code>rc</code> containing its reduced costs, and an initial point <code>x</code> interior to the LP&rsquo;s feasible region. Optional arguments to the function include a tolerance, for detecting when the method is within an acceptable distance from the optimal point, and a value for <code>R</code>, which must be strictly between 0 and 1 and controls scaling.</p>
<p>The method works by rescaling the matrix <code>A</code> around the current solution <code>x</code>. It then computes a new <code>x</code> such that it remains feasible and interior, which is why <code>R</code> cannot be 0 or 1. It requires a feasible interior point to start and only projects to other feasible interior points, so the right hand side of the LP is not required (it is implicit from the starting point). The shadow prices for each iteration are captured in the vector lambda, so the gap between primal and dual solutions is easy to compute.</p>
<p>We run this function against a 3x3 LP with a known solution:</p>

      <description>Scheme to Python transpiler</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p>For the final JAPH in this series, I implemented a simple transpiler that converts a small subset of <a href="https://www.scheme.org/">Scheme</a> programs to equivalent Python programs. It starts with a Scheme program that prints <code>'just another scheme hacker'</code>.</p>

      <description>Python obfuscation with a Turing machine</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p>This JAPH uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>. The machine accepts any string that ends in <code>'\n'</code> and allows side effects. This lets us print the value of the tape as it encounters each character. While the idea of using lambda functions as side effects in a Turing machine is a little bizarre on many levels, we work with what we have. And Python is multi-paradigmatic, so what the heck.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Obfuscation again consists of converting the above code into lambda functions using Y combinators. This is a nice programming exercise, so I&rsquo;ve left it out of this post in case anyone wants to try. The Turing machine has to return <code>'YES'</code> to indicate that it accepts the string, thus the assertion. Our final obfuscated JAPH is a single expression.</p>

      <description>Python obfuscation and Huffman coding</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p>At this point, tricking <code>python</code> into printing strings via indirect means got a little boring. So I switched to obfuscating fundamental computer science algorithms. Here&rsquo;s a JAPH that takes in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coded</a> version of <code>'just another python hacker'</code>, decodes, and prints it.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There&rsquo;s a catch here, which is that this is hard to obfuscate unless we turn it into a single expression. This means that we have to convert <code>build_tree</code> and <code>decode</code> into lambda functions. Unfortunately, they are recursive and lambda functions recurse naturally. Fortunately, we can use <a href="https://code.activestate.com/recipes/576366-y-combinator/">Y combinators</a> to get around the problem. These are worth some study since they will pop up again in future JAPHs.</p>

      <description>Python obfuscation with a cute visual effect</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was updated to work with Python 3.12. It may not work with different versions.</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a JAPH composed solely for effect. For each letter in <code>'just another python hacker'</code> it loops over each the characters <code>' abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'</code>, printing each. Between characters it pauses for 0.05 seconds, backing up and moving on to the next if it hasn&rsquo;t reached the desired one yet. This achieves a sort of rolling effect by which the final string appears on our screen over time.</p>

<p>No series of JAPHs would be complete without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13</a>. This is the example through which aspiring Perl programmers learn to use <code>tr</code> and its synonym <code>y</code>. In Perl the basic ROT13 JAPH starts as:</p>

      <description>Python obfuscation</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p>Many years ago, I was a Perl programmer. Then one day I became disillusioned at the progress of Perl 6 and decided to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">import this</a>.</p>
<p>This seems to be a fairly common story for Perl to Python converts. While I haven&rsquo;t looked back much, there are a number of things I really miss about <code>perl</code> <em>(lower case intentional)</em>. I miss having value types in a dynamic language, magical and ill-advised use of <a href="https://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol3_1/tpj0301-0003.html">cryptocontext</a>, and sometimes even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040712204117/https://perldesignpatterns.com/?PseudoHash">pseudohashes</a> because they were inexcusably weird. A language that supports so many ideas out of the box enables an extended learning curve that lasts for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020607034341/https://silver.sucs.org/~manic/humour/languages/perlhacker.htm">many years</a>. &ldquo;Perl itself is the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of all I think I miss writing Perl <a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node=Perl%20Poetry">poetry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_another_Perl_hacker">JAPHs</a>. Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t keep any of those I wrote, and I&rsquo;m not competent enough with the language anymore to write interesting ones. At the time I was intentionally distancing myself from a model that was largely implicit and based on archaic systems internals and moving to one that was (supposedly) explicit and simple.</p>
<p>After switching to Python as my primary language, I used the following email signature in a nod to this change in orientation <em>(intended for Python 2)</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;just another python hacker&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with writing JAPHs in Python. I think of these as &ldquo;reformed JAPHs.&rdquo; They accomplish the same purpose as programming exercises but in a more restricted context. In some ways they are more challenging. Creativity can be difficult in a narrowly defined landscape.</p>
<p>I have written a small series of reformed JAPHs which increase monotonically in complexity. Here is the first one, written in plain understandable Python 3.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> string

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is fairly simple. Instead of explicitly embedding the string <code>'just another python hacker'</code> in the program, we assemble it using the index of its letters in the string <code>'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz '</code>. We then obfuscate through a series of minor measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of calling the print function, we <code>import sys</code> and make a call to <code>sys.stdout.write</code>.</li>
<li>We assemble <code>string.lowercase + ' '</code> by joining together the character versions of its respective ordinal values (97 to 123 and 32).</li>
<li>We join together the integer indices using <code>'l'</code> and split that into a list.</li>
<li>We apply <code>'''</code> liberally and rely on the fact that <code>python</code> concatenates adjacent strings.</li>

      <title>📈 Simulating GDP Growth</title>

      <description>Writing and interpreting simulations about GDP growth in R</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope you saw <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/china-growth/">&ldquo;China’s way to the top&rdquo;</a> on the Post&rsquo;s website recently. It&rsquo;s a very clear presentation of their statement and is certainly worth a look.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So say you&rsquo;re an economist and you actually do need to produce a realistic estimate of when China&rsquo;s GDP surpasses that of the USA. Can you use such an approach? Not really.  There are several simplifying assumptions the Post made that are perfectly reasonable.  However, if the goal is an analytical output from a highly random system such as GDP growth, one should not assume the inputs are fixed. <em>(I&rsquo;m not saying I have any gripe with their interactive. This post has a different purpose.)</em></p>
<p>Why is this? The short answer is that randomness in any system can change its output drastically from one run to the next. Even if the mean from a deterministic analysis is correct, it tells us nothing about the variance of our output. We really need a confidence interval of years when China is likely to overtake the USA.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll move in the great tradition of all simulation studies. First we pepare our input. A CSV of GDP in current US dollars for both countries from 1960 to 2009 is available from the World Bank <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/country/china">data</a> <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/country/usa">files</a>. We read this into a data frame and calculate their growth rates year over year. Note that the first value for growth has to be NA.</p>

In a full study this would involve comparing a number of different distributions and choosing the one that fits the input data best, but that&rsquo;s well beyond the scope of this post. Instead, we&rsquo;ll use the poor man&rsquo;s way out: plot histograms and visually verify what we hope to be true, that the distributions are normal.</p>

<p>And they pretty much are. That&rsquo;s good enough for our purposes. Now all we need are the distribution parameters, which are mean and standard deviation for normal distributions.</p>

<p>This should make the advantage of such an approach much more obvious. Compare the standard deviations for the two countries. China is a lot more likely to have negative GDP growth in any given year. They&rsquo;re also more likely to have astronomical growth.</p>
<p>We now build and run our simulation study. The more times we run the simulation the tighter we can make our confidence interval <em>(to a point)</em>, so we&rsquo;ll pick a pretty big number somewhat arbitrarily.

<ul>
<li>We assume we actually used the right data set. This was more of a how-to than a proper analysis, so that wasn&rsquo;t too much of a concern.</li>
<li>We assume future growth for the next 40-50 years resembles past growth from 1960-2009.  This is a bit ridiculous, of course, but that&rsquo;s the problem with forecasting.</li>
<li>*We assume growth is normally distributed and that we don&rsquo;t encounter heavy-tailed behaviors in our distributions. We assume each year&rsquo;s growth is independent of the year before it. See the last exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some good simulation exercises if you&rsquo;re looking to do more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Note how the outputs are quite a bit different from the Post graphic. I expect that&rsquo;s largely due to the inclusion of data back to 1960. Try running the simulation for yourself using just the past 10, 20, and 30 years and see how that changes the result.&lt;</li>
<li>Write a simulation to determine the probability China&rsquo;s GDP surpasses the USA&rsquo;s in the next 25 years. Now plot the mean GDP and 95% confidence intervals for each country per year.</li>
<li>Assume that there are actually two distributions for growth for each country: one when the previous year had positive growth and another when it was negative. How does that change the output?</li>

      <description>Predict how much people like cats and dogs based on their ice cream preferences. Also, R.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was updated to include an example data file.</em></p>
<p>I thought it might be useful to follow up the <a href="../2011-02-15-data-fitting-2-very-very-simple-linear-regression-in-python/">last post</a> with another one showing the same examples in R.</p>
<p>R provides a function called <code>lm</code>, which is similar in spirit to <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>&rsquo;s <code>linalg.lstsq</code>. As you&rsquo;ll see, <code>lm</code>&rsquo;s interface is a bit more tuned to the concepts of modeling.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We begin by reading in the <a href="/files/2011-02-16-data-fitting-2a-very-very-simple-linear-regression-in-r/example_data.csv">example CSV</a> into a data frame:</p>

We do this by adding extra terms to the modeling formula. The <code>I()</code> function allows us to easily add additional operators to columns. That&rsquo;s how we accomplish the squaring. We could alternatively add squared input values to the data frame, but using <code>I()</code> is more convenient and natural.</p>

      <description>Predict how much people like cats and dogs based on their ice cream preferences. Also, Python and numpy.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is based on a memo I sent to some former colleagues at the Post. I&rsquo;ve edited it for use here since it fits well as the second in a series on simple data fitting techniques. If you&rsquo;re among the many enlightened individuals already using regression analysis, then this post is probably not for you. If you aren&rsquo;t, then hopefully this provides everything you need to develop rudimentary predictive models that yield surprising levels of accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>For purposes of a simple working example, we have collected six records of input data over three dimensions with the goal of predicting two outputs. The input data are:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
x_1 &amp;= \text{How much a respondent likes vanilla [0-10]}\\
x_2 &amp;= \text{How much a respondent likes strawberry [0-10]}\\
x_3 &amp;= \text{How much a respondent likes chocolate [0-10]}
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>Output data consist of:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
b_1 &amp;= \text{How much a respondent likes dogs [0-10]}\\
b_2 &amp;= \text{How much a respondent likes cats [0-10]}
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>Below are anonymous data collected from a random sample of people.</p>

<p>Our input is in three dimensions. Each output requires its own model, so we&rsquo;ll have one for dogs and one for cats. We&rsquo;re looking for functions, <code>dog(x)</code> and <code>cat(x)</code>, that can predict $b_1$ and $b_2$ based on given values of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$.</p>
<h2 id="model-1">Model 1</h2>
<p>For both models we want to find parameters that minimize their squared residuals (read: errors). There&rsquo;s a number of names for this. Optimization folks like to think of it as unconstrained quadratic optimization, but it&rsquo;s more common to call it least squares or linear regression. It&rsquo;s not necessary to entirely understand why for our purposes, but the function that minimizes these errors is:</p>
<p>$$\beta = ({A^t}A)^{-1}{A^t}b$$</p>
<p>This is implemented for you in the <code>numpy.linalg</code> Python package, which we&rsquo;ll use for examples. Much more information than you probably want can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">here</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a first stab at a Python version. It runs least squares against our input and output data exactly as they are. You can see the matrix $A$ and outputs $b_1$ and $b_2$ (dog and cat love, respectively) are represented just as they are in the table.</p>

<h2 id="model-2">Model 2</h2>
<p>One problem with this model is that <code>dog(x)</code> and <code>cat(x)</code> are forced to pass through the origin. <em>(Why is that?)</em> We can improve it somewhat if we add an offset. This amounts to prepending 1 to every row in $A$ and adding a constant to the resulting functions. You can see the very slight difference between the code for this model and that of the previous:</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>dog(x)</code> and <code>cat(x)</code> are linear functions. Most observed data don&rsquo;t conform to straight lines. Take a moment and draw the line $f(x) = x$ and the curve $f(x) = x^2$. The former makes a poor approximation of the latter.</p>
<p>Most of the time, people just use squares of the input data to add curvature to their models. We do this in our next version of the code by just adding squares of the input row values to our $A$ matrix. Everything else is the same. (In reality, you can add any function of the input data you feel best models the data, if you understand it well enough.)</p>

      <title>🗳 Off the Cuff Voter Fraud Detection</title>

      <description>Using the exponential distribution to interpret votes in a web survey</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consider this scenario: You run a contest that accepts votes from the general Internet population. In order to encourage user engagement, you record any and all votes into a database over several days, storing nothing more than the competitor voted for, when each vote is cast, and a cookie set on the voter&rsquo;s computer along with their apparent IP addresses. If a voter already has a recorded cookie set they are denied subsequent votes. This way you can avoid requiring site registration, a huge turnoff for your users. Simple enough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of the competitors are wily and attached to the idea of winning. They go so far as programming or hiring bots to cast thousands of votes for them. Your manager wants to know which votes are real and which ones are fake Right Now. Given very limited time, and ignoring actions that you <em>could</em> have taken to avoid the problem, how can you tell apart sets of good votes from those that shouldn&rsquo;t be counted?</p>
<p>One quick-and-dirty option involves comparing histograms of <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5417319_calculate-interarrival-time.html">interarrival times</a> for sets of votes. Say you&rsquo;re concerned that all the votes during a particular period of time or from a given IP address might be fraudulent. Put all the vote times you&rsquo;re concerned about into a list, sort them, and compute their differences:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># times is a list of datetime instances from vote records</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>times<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>sort(reversed<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>interarrivals <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [y<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>x <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> x, y <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> zip(times, times[<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:]]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now use matplotlib to <a href="https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/users/pyplot_tutorial.html#working-with-text">display a histogram</a> of these. Votes that occur naturally are likely to resemble an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential distribution</a> in their interarrival times. For instance, here are interarrival times for all votes received in a contest:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2010-11-30-off-the-cuff-voter-fraud-detection/all-votes.png" alt="Interarrival times for all submissions"  />
</p>
<p>This subset of votes is clearly fraudulent, due to the near determinism of their interarrival times. This is most likely caused by the voting bot not taking random sleep intervals during voting. It casts a vote, receives a response, clears its cookies, and repeats:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2010-11-30-off-the-cuff-voter-fraud-detection/fraud-plot.png" alt="Interarrival times for clearly fraudulent votes"  />
</p>
<p>These votes, on the other hand, are most likely legitimate. They exhibit a nice <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Erlang<!-- raw HTML omitted --> shape and appear to have natural interarrival times that one would expect:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/files/2010-11-30-off-the-cuff-voter-fraud-detection/not-fraud.png" alt="Proper-looking interarrival times"  />
</p>
<p>Of course this method is woefully inadequate for rigorous detection of voting fraud. Ideally one would find a method to compute the probability that a set of votes is generated by a bot. This is enough to inform quick, ad hoc decisions though.</p>

      <title>🧐 Data Fitting 1 - Linear Data Fitting</title>
      <link>https://ryanjoneil.github.io/posts/2010-11-23-data-fitting-1-linear-data-fitting/</link>

      <description>An introduction to data fitting and classification using linear optimization in Python</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was updated to work with Python 3 and <a href="https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt">PySCIPOpt</a>. The original version used Python 2 and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-zibopt/">python-zibopt</a>.</em></p>
<p>Data fitting is one of those tasks that everyone should have at least some exposure to. Certainly developers and analysts will benefit from a working knowledge of its fundamentals and their implementations. However, in my own reading I&rsquo;ve found it difficult to locate good examples that are simple enough to pick up quickly and come with accompanying source code.</p>
<p>This article commences an ongoing series introducing basic data fitting techniques. With any luck they won&rsquo;t be overly complex, while still being useful enough to get the point across with a real example and real data. We&rsquo;ll start with a binary classification problem: presented with a series of records, each containing a set number of input values describing it, determine whether or not each record exhibits some property.</p>
<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use the <code>cancer1.dt</code> data from the <code>proben1</code> set of test cases, which you can download <a href="/files/2010-11-23-data-fitting-1-linear-data-fitting/cancer1.dt">here</a>. Each record starts with 9 data points containing physical characteristics of a tumor. The second to last data point contains 1 if a tumor is benign and 0 if it is malignant. We seek to find a linear function we can run on an arbitrary record that will return a value greater than zero if that record&rsquo;s tumor is predicted to be benign and less than zero if it is predicted to be malignant. We will train our linear model on the first 350 records, and test it for accuracy on the remaining rows.</p>
<p>This is similar to the data fitting problem found in <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/linear-programming-series-of-books-in-the-mathematical-sciences_vasek-chvatal/249798/#edition=2416723&amp;idiq=15706498">Chvatal</a>. Our inputs consist of a matrix of observed data, $A$, and a vector of classifications, $b$. In order to classify a record, we require another vector $x$ such that the dot product of $x$ and that record will be either greater or less than zero depending on its predicted classification.</p>
<p>A couple points to note before we start:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most observed data are noisy. This means it may be impossible to locate a hyperplane that cleanly separates given records of one type from another. In this case, we must resort to finding a function that minimizes our predictive error. For the purposes of this example, we&rsquo;ll minimize the sum of the absolute values of the observed and predicted values. That is, we seek $x$ such that we find $min \sum_i{|a_i^T x-b_i|}$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.purplemath.com/modules/strtlneq.htm">slope-intercept</a> form of a line, $f(x)=m^T x+b$, contains an offset. It should be obvious that this is necessary in our model so that our function isn&rsquo;t required to pass through the origin. Thus, we&rsquo;ll be adding an extra variable with the coefficient of 1 to represent our offset value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to model this, we use two linear constraints for each absolute value. We minimize the sum of these. Our Linear Programming model thus looks like:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
\min\quad       &amp; z = x_0 + \sum_i{v_i}\\
\text{s.t.}\quad&amp; v_i \geq x_0 + a_i^\intercal x - 1    &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\quad\text{benign tumors}\\
&amp; v_i \geq 1 - x_0 - a_i^\intercal x    &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\quad\text{benign tumors}\\
&amp; v_i \geq x_0 + a_i^\intercal x - (-1) &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\quad\text{malignant tumors}\\
&amp; v_i \geq -1 - x_0 - a_i^\intercal x   &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\quad\text{malignant tumors}
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>In order to do this in Python, we use <a href="https://www.scipopt.org/">SCIP</a> and <a href="https://soplex.zib.de/">SoPlex</a>. We start by setting constants for benign and malignant outputs and providing a function to read in the training and testing data sets.</p>

      <description>A quick introduction to writing and interpreting Monte Carlo simulations in Python</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post was updated to work with Python 3.</em></p>
<p>One of the most useful tools one learns in an Operations Research curriculum is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo Simulation</a>. Its utility lies in its simplicity: one can learn vital information about nearly any process, be it deterministic or stochastic, without wading through the grunt work of finding an analytical solution. It can be used for off-the-cuff estimates or as a proper scientific tool. All one needs to know is how to simulate a given process and its appropriate probability distributions and parameters if that process is stochastic.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construct a simulation that, given input values, returns a value of interest. This could be a pure quantity, like time spent waiting for a bus, or a boolean indicating whether or not a particular event occurs.</li>
<li>Run the simulation a, usually large, number of times, each time with randomly generated input variables. Record its output values.</li>
<li>Compute sample mean and variance of the output values.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of time spent waiting for a bus, the sample mean and variance are estimators of mean and variance for one&rsquo;s wait time. In the boolean case, these represent probability that the given event will occur.</p>
<p>One can think of Monte Carlo Simulation as throwing darts. Say you want to find the area under a curve without integrating. All you must do is draw the curve on a wall and throw darts at it randomly. After you&rsquo;ve thrown enough darts, the area under the curve can be approximated using the percentage of darts that end up under the curve times the total area.</p>
<p>This technique is often performed using a spreadsheet, but that can be a bit clunky and may make more complex simulations difficult. I&rsquo;d like to spend a minute showing how it can be done in Python. Consider the following scenario:</p>
<p>Passengers for a train arrive according to a Poisson process with a mean of 100 per hour. The next train arrives exponentially with a rate of 5 per hour. How many passers will be aboard the train?</p>
<p>We can simulate this using the fact that a Poisson process can be represented as a string of events occurring with exponential inter-arrival times. We use the <code>sim()</code> function below to generate the number of passengers for random instances of the problem. We then compute sample mean and variance for these values.</p>

      <description>Using power sets in algebraic modeling languages for formulating the Traveling Salesman Problem</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the difficulties we encounter in solving the <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/">Traveling Salesman Problem</a> (TSP) is that, for even a small numer of cities, a complete description of the problem requires a factorial number of constraints. This is apparent in the standard formulation used to teach the TSP to OR students. Consider a set of $n$ cities with the distance from city $i$ to city $j$ denoted $d_{ij}$.  We attempt to minimize the total distance of a tour entering and leaving each city exactly once. $x_{ij} = 1$ if the edge from city $i$ to city $j$ is included in the tour, $0$ otherwise:</p>
<p>$$
\small
\begin{align*}
\min\quad       &amp; z = \sum_i \sum_{j\ne i} d_{ij} x_{ij}\\
\text{s.t.}\quad&amp; \sum_{j\ne i} x_{ij} = 1 &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i &amp; \text{leave each city once}\\
&amp; \sum_{i\ne j} x_{ij} = 1 &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ j &amp; \text{enter each city once}\\
&amp; x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}       &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ i,j
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>This appears like a reasonable formulation until we solve it and see that our solution contains disconnected subtours. Suppose we have four cities, labeled $A$ through $D$. Connecting $A$ to $B$, $B$ to $A$, $C$ to $D$ and $D$ to $C$ provides a feasible solution to our formulation, but does not constitute a cycle. Here is a more concrete example of two disconnected subtours $\{(1,5),(5,1)\}$ and $\{(2,3),(3,4),(4,2)\}$ over five cities:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ampl: display x;
x [*,*]
:   1   2   3   4   5    :=
1   0   0   0   0   1
2   0   0   1   0   0
3   0   0   0   1   0
4   0   1   0   0   0
5   1   0   0   0   0
;
</code></pre><p>Realizing we just solved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem">Assignment Problem</a>, we now add subtour elimination constraints. These require that any proper, non-null subset of our $n$ cities is connected by at most $n-1$ active edges:</p>
<p>$$
\sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in S} x_{ij} \leq |S|-1 \quad\forall\ S \subset {1, &hellip;, n}, S \ne O
$$</p>
<p>Indexing subtour elimination constraints over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set">power set</a> of the cities completes the formulation. However, this requires an additional $\sum_{k=2}^{n-1} \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix}$ rows tacked on the end of our matrix and is clearly infeasible for large $n$. The most current computers can handle using this approach <a href="http://zimpl.zib.de/download/zimpl.pdf">is around 19 cities</a>. It remains an instructive tool for understanding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion">combinatorial explosion</a> that occurs in problems like TSP and is worth translating into a modeling language. So how does one model it on a computer?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://ampl.com/">AMPL</a>, the gold standard in mathematical modeling languages, is unable to index over sets. Creating a power set in AMPL requires going through a few contortions.  The following code demonstrates power and index sets over four cities:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>set cities := 1 .. 4 ordered;

param n := card(cities);
set indices := 0 .. (2^n - 1);
set power {i in indices} := {c in cities: (i div 2^(ord(c) - 1)) mod 2 = 1};

display cities;
display n;
display indices;
display power;
</code></pre><p>This yields the following output:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>set cities := 1 2 3 4;

n = 4

set indices := 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15;

set power[0] := ; # empty
set power[1] := 1;
set power[2] := 2;
set power[3] := 1 2;
set power[4] := 3;
set power[5] := 1 3;
set power[6] := 2 3;
set power[7] := 1 2 3;
set power[8] := 4;
set power[9] := 1 4;
set power[10] := 2 4;
set power[11] := 1 2 4;
set power[12] := 3 4;
set power[13] := 1 3 4;
set power[14] := 2 3 4;
set power[15] := 1 2 3 4;
</code></pre><p>Note how the index set contains an index for each row in our power set. We can now generate the subtour elimination constraints:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>var x {cities cross cities} binary;
s.t. subtours {i in indices: card(power[i]) &gt; 1 and card(power[i]) &lt; card(cities)}:
sum {(c,k) in power[i] cross power[i]: k != c} x[c,k] &lt;= card(power[i]) - 1;

expand subtours;

subject to subtours[3]:  x[1,2] + x[2,1] &lt;= 1;
subject to subtours[5]:  x[1,3] + x[3,1] &lt;= 1;
subject to subtours[6]:  x[2,3] + x[3,2] &lt;= 1;
subject to subtours[7]:  x[1,2] + x[1,3] + x[2,1] + x[2,3] + x[3,1] + x[3,2] &lt;= 2;
subject to subtours[9]:  x[1,4] + x[4,1] &lt;= 1;
subject to subtours[10]: x[2,4] + x[4,2] &lt;= 1;
subject to subtours[11]: x[1,2] + x[1,4] + x[2,1] + x[2,4] + x[4,1] + x[4,2] &lt;= 2;
subject to subtours[12]: x[3,4] + x[4,3] &lt;= 1;
subject to subtours[13]: x[1,3] + x[1,4] + x[3,1] + x[3,4] + x[4,1] + x[4,3] &lt;= 2;
subject to subtours[14]: x[2,3] + x[2,4] + x[3,2] + x[3,4] + x[4,2] + x[4,3] &lt;= 2;
</code></pre><p>While this does work, the code for generating the power set looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_programming">voodoo</a>. Understanding it required piece-by-piece decomposition, an exercise I suggest you go through yourself if you have a copy of AMPL and 15 minutes to spare:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>set foo {c in cities} := {ord(c)};
set bar {c in cities} := {2^(ord(c) - 1)};
set baz {i in indices} := {c in cities: i div 2^(ord(c) - 1)};
set qux {i in indices} := {c in cities: (i div 2^(ord(c) - 1)) mod 2 = 1};

display foo;
display bar;
display baz;
display qux;
</code></pre><p>This may be an instance where open source leads commercial software. The good folks who produce the <a href="https://scipopt.org/">SCIP Optimization Suite</a> provide an AMPL-like language called <a href="https://zimpl.zib.de/">ZIMPL</a> with a few additional useful features. One of these is power sets. Compared to the code above, doesn&rsquo;t this look refreshing?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>set cities := {1 to 4};

set power[] := powerset(cities);
set indices := indexset(power);
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>📐 Uncapacitated Lot Sizing</title>

      <description>Formulation and aspects of the Uncapacitated Lot Sizing problem in Integer Programming</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uncapacitated Lot Sizing (ULS) is a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research">OR</a> problem that seeks to minimize the cost of satisfying known demand for a product over time.  Demand is subject to varying costs for production, set-up, and storage of the product.  Technically, it is a mixed binary integer linear program &ndash; the key point separating it from the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear optimization</a> being that production cannot occur during any period without paying that period&rsquo;s fixed costs for set-up.  Thus it has linear nonnegative variables for production and storage amounts during each period, and a binary variable for each period that determines whether or not production can actually occur.</p>
<p>For $n$ periods with per-period fixed set-up cost $f_t$, unit production cost $p_t$, unit storage cost $h_t$,and demand $d_t$, we define decision variables related to production and storage quantities:</p>
<p>$$
\small
\begin{align*}
x_t &amp;= \text{units produced in period}\ t\\
s_t &amp;= \text{stock at the end of period}\ t\\
y_t &amp;= 1\ \text{if production occurs in period}\ t, 0\ \text{otherwise}
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>One can minimize overall cost for satisfying all demand on time using the following model per <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Integer-Programming-Laurence-Wolsey/dp/0471283665/">Wolsey (1998)</a>, defined slightly differently here:</p>
<p>$$
\small
\begin{align*}
\min\quad       &amp; z = \sum_t{p_t x_t} + \sum_t{h_t s_t} + \sum_t{f_t y_t}\\
\text{s.t.}\quad&amp; s_1 = d_1 + s_1\\
&amp; s_{t-1} + x_t = d_t + s_t &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t &gt; 1\\
&amp; x_t \leq M y_t            &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t\\
&amp; s_t, x_t \geq 0           &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t\\
&amp; y_t \in {0,1}           &amp;\quad\forall&amp;\ t
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>According to Wolsey, page 11, given that $s_t = \sum_{i=1}^t (x_i - d_i)$ and defining new constants $K = \sum_{t=1}^n h_t(\sum_{i=1}^t d_i)$ and $c_t = p_t + \sum_{i=t}^n h_i$, the objective function can be rewritten as $z = \sum_t c_t x_t + \sum _t f_t y_t - K$.  The book lacks a proof of this and it seems a bit non-obvious, so I attempt an explanation in somewhat painstaking detail here.</p>
<p>$$
\small
\begin{align*}
&amp;\text{Proof}:\\
&amp; &amp; \sum_t p_t x_t + \sum_t h_t s_t + \sum_t f_t y_t &amp;= \sum_t c_t x_t + \sum _t f_t y_t - K\\
&amp;\text{1. Remove} \sum_t f_t y_t:\\
&amp; &amp; \sum_t p_t x_t + \sum_t h_t s_t &amp;= \sum_t c_t x_t - K\\
&amp;\text{2. Expand}\ K\ \text{and}\ c_t:\\
&amp; &amp; \sum_t p_t x_t + \sum_t h_t s_t &amp;= \sum_t (p_t + \sum_{i=t}^n h_i) x_t - \sum_t h_t (\sum_{i=1}^t d_i)\\
&amp;\text{3. Remove}\ \sum_t p_t x_t:\\
&amp; &amp; \sum_t h_t s_t &amp;= \sum_t x_t (\sum_{i=t}^n h_i) - \sum_t h_t (\sum_{i=1}^t d_i)\\
&amp;\text{4. Expand}\ s_t:\\
&amp; &amp; \sum_t h_t (\sum_{i=1}^t x_i) - \sum_t h_t (\sum_{i=1}^t d_i) &amp;= \sum_t x_t (\sum_{i=t}^n h_i) - \sum_t h_t (\sum_{i=1}^t d_i)\\
&amp;\text{5. Remove}\ \sum_t h_t (\sum_{i=1}^t d_i):\\
&amp; &amp; \sum_t h_t (\sum_{i=1}^t x_i) &amp;= \sum_t x_t (\sum_{i=t}^n h_i)
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>The result from step 5 becomes obvious upon expanding its left and right-hand terms:</p>
<p>$$
h_1 x_1 + h_2 (x_1 + x_2) + \cdots + h_n (x_1 + \cdots + x_n) =\\
x_1 (h_1 + \cdots + h_n) + x2 (h_2 + \cdots + h_n) + \cdots + x_n h_n
$$</p>
<p>In matrix notation with $h$ and $x$ as column vectors in $\bf R^n$ and $L$ and $U$ being $n \times n$ lower and upper triangular identity matrices, respectively, this can be written as:</p>
<p>$$
\small
\begin{pmatrix}
h_1 \cdots h_n
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \cdots 0 \\
\vdots \ddots \vdots \\
1 \cdots 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \cdots x_n
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \cdots 1 \\
\vdots \ddots \vdots \\
0 \cdots 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
h_1 \\
\vdots \\
h_n
\end{pmatrix}
$$</p>
<p>or $h^T L x = x^T U h$.</p>
